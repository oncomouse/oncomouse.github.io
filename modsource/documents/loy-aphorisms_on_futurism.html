          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">Die</strong> in the Past<br />
          Live in the Future.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">The</strong> velocity of velocities arrives in starting.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">In</strong> pressing the material to derive its essence, matter becomes deformed.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">And</strong> form hurtling against itself is thrown beyond the synopsis of vision.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">The</strong> straight line and the circle are the parents of design, form the basis of art; there is no limit to their coherent variability.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">Love</strong> the hideous in order to find the sublime core of it.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">Open</strong> your arms to the dilapidated; rehabilitate them.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">You</strong> prefer to observe the past on which your eyes are already opened.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">But</strong> the Future is only dark from outside.
          Leap into it<strong class="dashes">—</strong>and it <strong class="text-uppercase weak">Explodes</strong> with Light.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">Forget</strong> that you live in houses, that you may live in yourself<strong class="dashes">—</strong></p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">For</strong> the smallest people live in the greatest houses.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">But</strong> the smallest person, potentially, is as great as the Universe.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">What</strong> can you know of expansion, who limit yourselves to compromise?</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">Hitherto</strong> the great man has achieved greatness by keeping the people small.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">But</strong> in the Future, by inspiring the people to expand to their fullest capacity, the great man proportionately must be tremendous<strong class="dashes">—</strong>a God.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">Love</strong> of others is the appreciation of oneself.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">May</strong> your egotism be so gigantic that you comprise mankind in your self-sympathy.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">The</strong> Future is limitless<strong class="dashes">—</strong>the past a trail of insidious reactions.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">Life</strong> is only limited by our prejudices. Destroy them, and you cease to be at the mercy of yourself.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">Time</strong> is the dispersion of intensiveness.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">The</strong> Futurist can live a thousand years in one poem.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">He</strong> can compress every aesthetic principle in one line.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">The</strong> mind is a magician bound by assimilations; let him loose and the smallest idea conceived in freedom will suffice to negate the wisdom of all forefathers.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">Looking</strong> on the past you arrive at “Yes,” but before you can act upon it you have already arrived at “No.”</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">The</strong> Futurist must leap from affirmative to affirmative, ignoring intermittent negations<strong class="dashes">—</strong>must spring from stepping-stone to stone of creative exploration; without slipping back into the turbid stream of accepted facts.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">There</strong> are no excrescences on the absolute, to which man may pin his faith.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">Today</strong> is the crisis in consciousness.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">Consciousness</strong> cannot spontaneously accept or reject new forms, as offered by creative genius; it is the new form, for however great a period of time it may remain a mere irritant<strong class="dashes">—</strong>that molds consciousness to the necessary amplitude for holding it.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">Consciousness</strong> has no climax.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">Let</strong> the Universe flow into your consciousness, there is no limit to its capacity, nothing that it shall not re-create.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">Unscrew</strong> your capability of absorption and grasp the elements of Life<strong class="dashes">—</strong>Whole.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">Misery</strong> is in the disintegration of Joy;<br />
          Intellect, of Intuition;<br />
          Acceptance, of Inspiration.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">Cease</strong> to build up your personality with the ejections of irrelevant minds.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">Not</strong> to be a cipher in your ambiente,<br />
          But to color your ambient with your preferences.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">Not</strong> to accept experience at its face value.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">But</strong> to readjust activity to the peculiarity of your own will.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">These</strong> are the primary tentatives towards independence.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">Man</strong> is a slave only to his own mental lethargy.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">You</strong> cannot restrict the mind’s capacity.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">Therefore</strong> you stand not only in abject servitude to your perceptive consciousness<strong class="dashes">—</strong></p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">But</strong> also to the mechanical re-actions of the subconsciousness, that rubbish heap of race-tradition<strong class="dashes">—</strong></p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">And</strong> believing yourself to be free<strong class="dashes">—</strong>your least conception is colored by the pigment of retrograde superstitions.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">Here</strong> are the fallow-lands of mental spatiality that Futurism will clear<strong class="dashes">—</strong></p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">Making</strong> place for whatever you are brave enough, beautiful enough to draw out of the realized self.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">To</strong> your blushing we shout the obscenities, we scream the blasphemies, that you, being weak, whisper alone in the dark.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">They</strong> are empty except of your shame.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">And</strong> so these sounds shall dissolve back to their innate senselessness.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">Thus</strong> shall evolve the language of the Future.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">Through</strong> derision of Humanity as it appears<strong class="dashes">—</strong></p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">To</strong> arrive at respect for man as he shall be<strong class="dashes">—</strong></p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-uppercase weak">Accept</strong> the tremendous truth of Futurism<br />
