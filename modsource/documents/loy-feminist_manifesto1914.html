          <p>The feminist movement as at present instituted is<br />
          <strong class="weak h3 u">Inadequate</strong></p>
          
          <p><em class="h4 u no-em weak">Women</em> if you want to realize yourselves-you are on the<br />
          eve of a devastating psychological upheaval-all your pet illu-<br />

          <p>Cease to place your confidence in economic legislation, vice-<br />
          crusades &amp; uniform education-you are glossing over<br />

          She is <strong class="weak h3 u">NOT</strong><em class="h4 no-em weak">!</em></p>
          
          <p>The man who lives a life in which his activities conform to a<br />
          social code which is protectorate of the feminine element<strong class="dashes">—</strong><br />
          is no longer <em class="h4 u no-em weak">masculine</em><br />
          The women who adapt themselves to a theoretical valuation of<br />
          their sex as a <em class="h4 u no-em weak">relative</em> <em class="h4 u no-em weak">impersonality</em>, are not yet<br />
          <em class="h4 u no-em weak">Feminine</em><br />
          Leave off looking to men to find out what you are <em class="h4 u no-em weak">not</em> <strong class="dashes">—</strong>seek<br />
          within yourselves to find out what you <em class="h4 u no-em weak">are</em><br />
          As conditions are at present constituted<strong class="dashes">—</strong>you have the choice<br />
          between <strong class="weak h3 u">Parasitism</strong><strong class="h3 weak">, &amp;</strong> <strong class="weak h3 u">Prostitution</strong><em class="h4 no-i"><strong class="dashes">—</strong>or</em> <em class="h4 u no-em weak">Negation</em></p>
          
          <p>Men &amp; women are enemies, with the enmity of the exploited<br />
          for the parasite, the parasite for the exploited<strong class="dashes">—</strong>at present they<br />
          are at the mercy of the advantage that each can take of the<br />
          others sexual dependence<strong class="dashes">—</strong>. The only point at which the<br />
          interests of the sexes merge<strong class="dashes">—</strong>is the sexual embrace.</p>
          
          <p>The first illusion it is to your interest to demolish is the<br />
          division of women into two classes    <em class="h4 u no-em weak">the mistress</em><em class="h4 no-i">,</em><br />
          <em class="h4 no-i">&amp;</em> <em class="h4 u no-em weak">the mother</em> every well-balanced &amp; developed woman<br />
          knows that is not true, Nature has endowed the complete<br />
          functions<strong class="dashes">—</strong>there are <em>no</em> <em>restrictions</em> on the woman who is<br />
          so incompletely evolved as to be un-self-conscious in sex, will<br />
          prove a restrictive influence on the temperamental expansion<br />
          of the next generation; the woman who is a poor mistress will<br />
          be an incompetent mother<strong class="dashes">—</strong>an inferior mentality<strong class="dashes">—</strong>&amp; will<br />
          enjoy an inadequate apprehension of <strong class="weak h3 u">Life</strong>.</p>
          
          <p>To obtain results you must make sacrifices &amp; the first &amp;<br />
          greatest sacrifice you have to make is of your ”virtue”<br />
          The fictitious value of a woman as identified with her physical<br />
          purity<strong class="dashes">—</strong>is too easy to stand-by<del>      </del> rendering her lethargic in<br />
          the acquisition of intrinsic merits of character by which she<br />
          could obtain a concrete value<strong class="dashes">—</strong>therefore, the fist self-<br />
          enforced law for the female sex, as a protection against the<br />
          man made bogey of virtue<strong class="dashes">—</strong>which is the principal instrument<br />
          of her subjection, would be the <em class="no-i u">unconditional</em> surgical<br />
          <em class="no-i u">destruction</em> <em class="no-i u">of</em> <em class="no-i u">virginity</em> through-out the female population at<br />
          puberty<strong class="dashes">—</strong>.</p>
          
          <p>The value of man is assessed entirely according to his use or<br />
          interest to the community, the value of woman depends<br />
          entirely on <em class="no-i u">chance</em>, her success or insuccess in maneouvering<br />
          a man into taking the life-long responsibility of her<strong class="dashes">—</strong><br />
          The advantages of marriage are too ridiculously ample<strong class="dashes">—</strong><br />
          compared to all other trades<strong class="dashes">—</strong>for under modern conditions a<br />
          woman can accept preposterously luxurious support from a<br />
          man (with-out the return of an sort<strong class="dashes">—</strong>even offspring)<strong class="dashes">—</strong>as a thank<br />
          offering for her virginity<br />
          The woman who has not succeeded in striking that<br />
          advantageous bargain<strong class="dashes">—</strong>is prohibited from any but <br />
          surreptitious re-action to Life-stimuli<strong class="dashes">—</strong><em class="big no-underline">&amp;</em> <em class="h4 u no-em weak">entirely</em><br />
          <em class="h4 u no-em weak">debarred</em> <strong class="weak h3 u">maternity.</strong><br />
          Every woman has a right to maternity<strong class="dashes">—</strong><br />
          Every woman of superior intelligence should realize her race-<br />
          responsibility, in producing children in adequate proportion to<br />
          the unfit or degenerate members of her sex<strong class="dashes">—</strong></p>
          
          <p>Each child of a superior woman should be the result of a<br />
          definite period of psychic development in her life<strong class="dashes">—</strong>&amp; and not<br />
          necessarily of a possible irksome &amp; outworn continuance of an<br />
          alliance<strong class="dashes">—</strong>spontaneously adapted for vital creation in the<br />
          beginning but not necessarily harmoniously balanced as the<br />
          parties to it<strong class="dashes">—</strong>follow their individual lines of personal<br />
          evolution<strong class="dashes">—</strong><br />
          For the harmony of race, each individual should be the<br />
          expression of an easy &amp; ample interpenetration of the male &amp;<br />
          female temperaments<strong class="dashes">—</strong>free of stress<br />
          Woman must become more responsible for the child than<br />
          man<strong class="dashes">—</strong><br />
          Woman must destroy in themselves, the desire to be loved<strong class="dashes">—</strong><br />
          The feeling that it is a personal insult when a man transfers<br />
          his attention from her to another woman<br />
          The desire for comfortable protection instead of an intelligent<br />
          curiosity &amp; courage in meeting &amp; resisting the pressure of life<br />
          sex or so called love must be reduced to its initial element,<br />
          honour, grief, sentimentality, pride and &amp; consequently jealousy<br />
          must be detached from it.<br />
          Woman for her happiness must retain her deceptive fragility of<br />
          appearance, combined with indomitable will, irreducible<br />
          courage, &amp; abundant health the outcome of sound nerves<strong class="dashes">—</strong><br />
          Another great illusion is that woman must use all her<br />
          introspective and clear-sightedness &amp; unbiassed bravery to<br />
          destroy<strong class="dashes">—</strong>for the sake of her <em class="no-i u">self</em> <em class="no-i u">respect</em> is the impurity of sex<br />
          the realization in defiance of superstition that there is <em class="no-i u">nothing</em><br />
          <em class="no-i u">impure</em> <em class="no-i u">in</em> <em class="no-i u">sex</em><strong class="dashes">—</strong>except in the mental attitude to it<strong class="dashes">—</strong>will <br />
          constitute an incalculable &amp; wider social regeneration than it<br />
          is possible for our generation to imagine.</p>
