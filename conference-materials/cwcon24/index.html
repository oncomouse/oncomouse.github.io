        In a video for <i>Textshop Experiments</i> entitled "Haptic Heuretics,"
        Jason Crider and Chloe Anna Milligan describe a WriteBox&#x2014;a
        Raspberry Pi running Linux and connected to a mechanical
        keyboard&#x2014;that helps them imagine writing technologies outside the
        remediated literate models of word processing applications. They talk
        about their system, deprioritizing graphical user interfaces in favor of
        the command line and requiring tinkering with the code ("getting our
        hands dirty") in order to reinvent writing for an electrate age and
        re-emerge the prospects for experimenting with print that were lost with
        the stabilization and normalization of literate practices.<sup

      </p>

      <p>
        Crider and Milligan position their WriteBox as an avant-garde
        experiment, which is weird for me, as I write on my self-built desktop
        computer running (<b><b>slide</b></b
        >) Arch Linux and typing into a 50-year-old text editor called (<b
          ><b>slide</b></b
        >) Vi with a (<b><b>slide</b></b
        >) custom-built mechanical keyboard. I guess what I'm trying to say is
        that it was a bit alienating watching their video for the first time,
        and seeing what has been my academic writing workflow for the last
        decade described as a cutting-edge practice experimenting at the limits
        of the written word.
      </p>

      <p>I thought I was just trying to get tenure.</p>

      <p>
        I bring all this up, today, though because I want to talk about why John
        Tinnell's biography of Mark Weiser,
        <i>The Philosopher of Palo Alto</i> resonates so strongly with me and
        has lead me to seriously consider the possibility that I might actually
        be doing something important vis-a-vis reinventing the possibilities of
        the written word. Moreover, I want to think about the (<b
          ><b>slide</b></b
        >) context of the keyboard-centric programs, both comparatively ancient
        ones such as Vi or Ratpoison (the mouseless window manager that provides
        a minimal GUI (mostly so I can watch YouTube), first released almost 25
        years ago) or the myriad recently-authored, high-powered CLI tools that
        are reinvigorating non-desktop-centric workflows for a variety of users.
        Based on these experiences, I want to tease a thread out of Weiser's
        work (and Tinnell's writing about him) that highlights how Weiser's
        dream of ubicomp shares two goals that are actually quite different but
        treated the same. On the one hand, we have the famous idea to re-world
        the computer, building ubiquitous computational power into a myriad of
        everyday smart environments in which our life opens outside the context
        of the computer desk. But, on the other hand, in a move that I don't
        think is even entirely clear to Weiser himself, ubicomp is positioning
        itself against what Crider and Milligan label as the black-boxing of the
        writing apparatus provided by the desktop computing paradigm. Based on
        Tinnell's biography of him and my own reading of Weiser's work, I get
        the distinct impression that Weiser hated desktop computing, and I
        wonder if the destabilizing of writing interfaces my practice represents
        might offer a solution to one of the two problems Weiser was working on.
        Further, this turn to retro-computing as another kind of post-desktop
        interface highlights the strong connection between Weiser's model of
        ubicomp&#x2014;tabs, pads, and boards&#x2014;and the UNIX philosophy of
        small, well-built digital tools working together in harmony.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this context, I also want to think about tools as Mark Weiser
        understood them and what this means for the two images of post-desktop
        computing he gives us: the version of ubiquitous computing we could have
        had and the version that he warned against in his writing that we got
        instead and have found, largely, to be terrible. As we know from reading
        Tinnell's biography and from reading Weiser's work, there are two famous
        models for the computing tools Weiser hoped to build at Xerox PARC: the
        candy bar wrapper, whose literate information practices are at-hand
        until we consult them, never commanding our attention; and the blind
        person's cane, which, as Tinnell draws out, Weiser sourced from reading
        Michael Polyani's work. The cane to Weiser is not felt by its users.
        Instead, vibrations transmitted up the shaft allow the wielder to feel
        the road. In the case of the candy bar wrapper, its information is there
        when we want it but does not solicit our attention when we do not; in
        the case of the cane, the cane is not the focus, the experience of the
        world thus facilitated is. In both cases, the tool itself vanishes.
      </p>

      <p>
        In "The World is Not a Desktop" (1994), Weiser once again uses the cane
        to introduce the invisible computers he hopes to build. He then
        contrasts this with a variety of vaporware&#x2014;virtual reality, voice
        activation, intelligent agents&#x2014;which now form the clanging,
        screeching, flashing attention-suck of contemporary mobile computing. In
        between these two poles, however, he briefly mentions vi, and this
        mention is where my own project begins.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here's what he says, and I think it's important to dwell on this for a
        second (<b><b>slide</b></b
        >):
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Of course, tools are not invisible in themselves, but as part of a
          context of use. With enough practice we can make many apparently
          difficult things disappear: my fingers know vi editing commands that
          my conscious mind has long forgotten. But good tools enhance
          invisibility.<sup
            ><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink"
              >2</a
            ></sup
          >
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        I'm assuming most of you don't know what vi is, so I'll explain it:
        there are two classic text editors developed in the 1970s that are still
        in fairly wide use today, vi and emacs. Both predate the IBM Common User
        Access (1987), which defined many of the editing operations we know and
        love, such as "cut" or "save," (which is why "yank" in vi performs what
        we would call "copy" in MS Word while "yank" in emacs performs what we
        would call "paste") and both have very particular ways of interacting
        with text. Vi in particular is what is known as a "modal editor" (and
        until a few years ago was basically the only text editor operating in
        this paradigm). (<b><b>slide</b></b
        >) In modal editing, operating on the text (deleting, yanking,
        navigating) is one mode in which the user can interact, inserting text
        is a second mode (there is also visual mode, which controls
        highlighting). The editor predates the general adoption of mice (and,
        importantly, predates the desktop paradigm), so everything is done via
        the keyboard, hence the reason for the different modes. In vi, in normal
        and visual modes, the characters <code>h</code>, <code>j</code>,
        <code>k</code>, and <code>l</code> control the cursor's position (left,
        down, up, and right), while in insert mode, they simply type the letters
        represented. Vi also has the concept of a textobject, things like words,
        sentences, and paragraphs, which are worked on in normal mode via
        operators. This is both part of vi's challenge to new users and its
        power for those who make use of it: you can do <b>everything</b> without
        having to take your hands off the keyboard: no menus, no mice, just
        typing. For instance, if I wanted to change the word my cursor was on in
        normal mode, I would type <code>ciw</code> (*c*hange, *i*nner, *w*ord),
        be placed into insert mode, type the new word, and hit
        <code>ESC</code> to return to normal mode. Things start getting really
        powerful when you discover that all operations can be multiplied by
        pressing a number before them, so <code>3yas</code> will yank the next
        three sentences to the clipboard.
      </p>

      <p>
        This all sounds very confusing, I would imagine, and vi has a
        notoriously steep learning curve. There's a bit of computer science lore
        that imagines both these editors as exotic, far-off islands that some
        programmers hear rumors of while a few programmers will dare to visit
        and even fewer still will choose to settle and stay. Despite this, (<b
          ><b>slide</b></b
        >) in the 2023 Stack Overflow Developer Survey of around 86,000 users,
        Vim (one of the two modern versions of vi in widespread use) ranked
        fifth amongst text editors with 22% daily usage (ahead of Jupyter
        Notebooks and Sublime Text), while Neovim (the newer, better fork of
        Vim) ranked tenth with 11.8% daily usage. I once explained to a
        colleague, echoing Weiser before I'd read him, that vi has taught me
        that "writing comes from my hands."
      </p>

      <p>
        Which brings me, I hope, back (<b><b>slide</b></b
        >) to Weiser's invocation in 1994: note the ambiguous "but" that
        transitions between "My fingers know vi" and "good tools enhance
        invisibility." What are we to take from this? "But" might imply that vi
        is not a good tool, or that its invisibility is despite of its
        difficulty. It's important for me to know which it is. Like Polyani's
        cane, I don't feel the computer, I feel the words in vi. Without the
        distraction of visual options such as formatting or having to move my
        hand off the home row, writing narrows to whatever my thoughts are and
        the hands that fashion those into words. An experience unlike Weiser's
        stated desire to "design a radically new kind of computer that could
        more deeply participate in the world of people" as Tinnell
        summarizes.<sup
          ><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink"
            >3</a
          ></sup
        >
        But, at the same time and by Weiser's own hesitant admission: vi is a
        good tool, if difficult to use. The crucial difference, from my
        experience, is that vi traps me in a world of my writing while the
        desktop paradigm traps me in its particular interface, becoming an
        impedement to my work.
      </p>

      <p>
        An emerging culture of new GUI-free tools seems to confirm my point. As
        I've mentioned, both version of Vim are in the top 10 most popular
        editors survey, but more pervasively, there has been a recent
        renaissance in command-line tools across the board. Programs such as (<b
          ><b>slide</b></b
        >) `fd` and `ripgrep` (which leverage modern programming languages such
        as Rust to greatly speed-up finding files), `fzf` (which uses fuzzy-find
        to quickly search and complete menus), and a variety of command-line
        clients for social-media, chat, and music all proliferating. Even modal
        editors, long confined solely to vi and derided as unnecessarily
        complicated, are being reinvigorated with editors such as Kakoune and
        Helix developing new version of the modal paradigm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Programs such as these constitute an emergent model of retro-computing:
        both old and ultra-modern at the same time. Retro-computing are
        increasingly useful given the variety of computing platforms (servers,
        cloud computing, etc) that do not have GUI capabilities, but, more so,
        the UNIX philosophy appeals, weirdly, as a post-desktop paradigm. As
        documented by Peter H. Salus in <i>A Quarter-Century of UNIX</i> (1994)
        (<b><b>slide</b></b
        >), there are three principles that governed the original development of
        UNIX:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <ol class="org-ol">
          <li>Write programs that do one thing and do it well.</li>
          <li>Write programs to work together.</li>
          <li>
            Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal
            interface.<sup
              ><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink"
                >4</a
              ></sup
            >
          </li>
        </ol>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Essentially, UNIX is composed of a number of small, full-featured
        programs that all interface with one-another to emerge more complicated
        functionality. (<b><b>slide</b></b
        >)Take <code>fzf</code>, a program I mentioned earlier which takes a
        list of strings and converts them into a searchable menu. On my system,
        I use fzf to find and quickly open files within a directory, sending the
        results of <code>fd</code> (which quickly lists files in a particular
        directory); but I can also send a list of songs in my current playlist
        in <code>mpd</code> (the Music Player Daemon) to select a new track to
        listen to. Fzf is a program for displaying menus, fd is a program for
        listing files, mpd is a program for playing music, but they allow for
        almost infinite workflow personalization.
      </p>

      <p>
        For careful readers of Weiser's work, this UNIX philosophy might sound
        like his proposal for ubiquitous computing built (<b><b>slide</b></b
        >) "tabs, pads, and boards".<sup
          ><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink"
            >5</a
          ></sup
        >
        Tabs, "the smallest yet most sophisticated of the three ubicomp building
        blocks" were tiny computers that interacted with one another as their
        users moved through an office space, displaying relevant information and
        constructing "a shape-shifting constellation, each day's end revealing a
        fresh portrait of the lab's people and things".<sup
          ><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6" role="doc-backlink"
            >6</a
          ></sup
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Tabs, then, form the location-aware, real-world building blocks of
        Weiser's ubicomp vision, but they also harken back to the Unix
        philosophy of doing one thing really well while working in concert to
        perform more complex tasks. UNIX defines an ecosystem of tools strangely
        akin to the post-desktop ecosystem Weiser imagined. The difference is
        that UNIX is still box-bound, a la desktop computing, while Weiser's
        stated aim (and the aspect of his work he most focused on) is building
        computing that facilitates its users engagement with their surroundings.
      </p>

      <p>
        The lynchpin here&#x2014;and one of the problems Weiser had to address
        due to his historical moment and his position as director of Xerox
        PARC&#x2014;is the desktop computer. Writing about the transition from
        CLI to GUI in <i>Actionable Media</i>, Tinnell notes that the GUI (<b
          ><b>slide</b></b
        >) "effectively broke down […] the command line interface into a new set
        of images, prescribed options, and standard protocols. Users could
        identify an option […] and simply click on it".<sup
          ><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7" role="doc-backlink"
            >7</a
          ></sup
        >
        For Weiser, attention-hungry interfaces demand a user (<b
          ><b>slide</b></b
        >) "withdraw from a course of local action in favor of tele-action".<sup
          ><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8" role="doc-backlink"
            >8</a
          ></sup
        >
        In analyzing the iPad as a failed model of Weiser's original ubicomp
        Pad, Lori Emerson highlights that slick GUI interfaces (and their mobile
        inheritors) work like stage magic in which (<b><b>slide</b></b
        >) "[the audience] must remain in the dark (literally and figuratively)
        about exactly how the trick works".<sup
          ><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9" role="doc-backlink"
            >9</a
          ></sup
        >Tracing the hype-centric news coverage of the iPad's launch in the
        context of Weiser's original ubicomp vision, Emerson suggests this
        withdrawal occurs because the iPad does it all without the user having
        to think.<sup
          ><a id="fnr.10" class="footref" href="#fn.10" role="doc-backlink"
            >10</a
          ></sup
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Desktops, and their mobile progeny, capture the full attention of their
        users and, more importantly, attempt to be the single source of all
        computation (in contrast to Weiser's suggestion (<b><b>slide</b></b
        >) to "spread many electronic pads around on the desk, just as you
        spread out papers" in "Computer for the 21st Century").<sup
          ><a id="fnr.11" class="footref" href="#fn.11" role="doc-backlink"
            >11</a
          ></sup
        >
        More importantly, though (and this is something you can find documented
        in Ellen Ullman's writing about the early web in
        <i>Close to the Machine</i
        ><sup
          ><a id="fnr.12" class="footref" href="#fn.12" role="doc-backlink"
            >12</a
          ></sup
        >
        and in Steven Levy's classic "A Spreadsheet Way of Knowledge"<sup
          ><a id="fnr.13" class="footref" href="#fn.13" role="doc-backlink"
            >13</a
          ></sup
        >), the desktop reduces all the complex richness afforded by
        shortcut-oriented, keyboard-centric interfaces in general (with perhaps
        "[cumbersome] bits of arbitrary command language" as Tinnell calls them)
        into a mouse pointer. As vi shows both Weiser and myself, muscle-memory
        takes over from the visual, allowing the editor to vanish.
      </p>

      <p>
        None of this richness gets me the world, though. My version of the
        Crider-Milligan WriteBox is built for writing: (<b><b>slide</b></b
        >) I autocomplete citations into my Markdown manuscripts using Neovim's
        completion system, those citation codes are generated by Zotero and
        compiled into a works cited page by Pandoc's citeproc package, I can
        import citations from Firefox automatically. My system, however, has
        trouble playing video games because ratpoison's support for fullscreen
        applications is dodgy, I'd rather send texts on my phone anyway, and I
        still can't watch Netflix in Linux.
      </p>

      <p>
        This leads me to my conclusion: that the desktop paradigm was a mistake
        and Mark Weiser, I think, figured it out first. As a professional
        wordsmith, I need something like my WriteBox (akin to George R.R.
        Martin's famous use of the outdated (and keyboard-centric) Wordstar to
        compose his Song of Ice and Fire novels) because crushing text as
        quickly and efficiently as possible is my job. Do my students need this?
        Probably not. Did random people buying Windows 95 on launch day need
        this? Almost certainly not.
      </p>

      <p>
        Weiser was imagining post-desktop computing for casual literacy
        practices on the go, not for the kind of intense writing I've been doing
        for the last few hours working on this talk. And that's fine. I think
        it's worth dwelling on, though, that desktop computing doesn't work for
        me either, and given the increasing general popularity of mechanical
        keyboards, the widespread adoption of tiling window managers such as
        Hyprland or i3 by hipster developers who would have worked on macOS a
        decade ago, and the perennial popularity of Vim, a growing segment of
        information workers recognize that desktop computing doesn't work for
        them, as well. I wonder, perhaps cheekily perhaps not, if desktop
        computing ever actually worked for anyone except PC makers and
        Microsoft.
      </p>

      <p>
        These are all, however, unexpected developments in personal computing
        that Weiser didn't live to see. At the time of his death in 1999, Linux
        was only 9 years old and had only had its (<b><b>slide</b></b
        >) first desktop environment (KDE) for less than a year. While (<b
          ><b>slide</b></b
        >)NextStep had been acquired by Apple, Mac OS X (also based on UNIX) was
        still two years away from release. While we could debate the merits of
        Apple's UNIX-usage, especially in light of recent decisions by the
        company, the point is that the possibility of UNIX as a personal OS (and
        therefore the ability to produce something like a WriteBox for oneself)
        was not as straightforwardly apparent during Weiser's life as it is now.
      </p>

      <p>
        While the struggle to imagine a more human-centric ubicomp future is
        still paramount especially given the increasing entanglement between the
        MIT Media Lab's concept of the intelligent agent (which largely won out
        as the dominant paradigm for ubicomp over Weiser's vision) and mass
        surveillance, we should also remain cognizant of the perniciousness of
        the desktop paradigm and the possibilities inherent in the forms of
        retro-computing I've been discussing to free our more intensely literate
        computing practices from its clutches.
