# Notes on using this file:
#
# DATES
# Dates must be formatted in a strict YYYY-MM-DD format, meaning you have to put
# a 0 in front of any single digit month or day numbers.
#
# For instance, the 6th of August 2020 would be 2020-08-06. Without the extra
# leading zero, this script won't work.
#
# DAYS OF THE WEEK
# Days of the week, for the meeting key and for the is_a key in redefined, must
# be written in all lower case. Days can have the following values:
#
# - monday
# - tuesday
# - wednesday
# - thursday
# - friday
# - saturday
#
# NAMES OF WEEKS
# For the weeks key, due to a quirk in how YAML works, the number of the week (
# e.g. week 1 or week 12) has to be in quotes. I know it's strange.
#
# Set to the semester's start date using the YYYY-MM-DD format discussed above.
start: 2019-08-26
# Set to the semester's end date using the YYYY-MM-DD format discussed above.
end: 2019-12-04
# This key lets you set any holidays in the semester. The date key should be set
# using the YYYY-MM-DD format discussed above and the name key can be set to any
# string allowed in YAML.
holidays:
  - date: 2019-11-27
    name: Thanksgiving
  - date: 2019-11-28
    name: Thanksgiving
  - date: 2019-11-29
    name: Thanksgiving
# If your university uses redefined days, you can set them here. Set the date
# in the YYYY-MM-DD format discussed above and the is_a key must be in
# lowercase.
redefined:
  - date: 2019-12-02
    is_a: thursday
  - date: 2019-12-03
    is_a: friday
# An array of days on which the class meets. These need to be all lowercase:
meets:
  - tuesday
  - thursday
# This key contains names for each week. Because a number cannot be the key for
# a mapping in YAML, we have to put the week number in quotes. It's strange,
# I know.

# This key contains an array of course meetings. Each course meeting will be
# parsed as Markdown, so you can use bold, italic, links, and lists.
#
# The | denotes a literal block, which means that any line breaks will be
# produced in the data but the line will not be otherwise broken. This kind of
# block notation allows multi-line content to be stored in a YAML array. We use
# it to hold our Markdown content. All lines of content in each meeting must be
# indented by four spaces at the start of the line.
