Specifically, we will be exploring two themes that inform the understanding of rhetoric during this period: the discovery of the unconscious and the belief that society is a system for exchanging messages. The unconscious describes a society dominated by primal impulses and subject to violent, erratic behavior. Systems thinking marks society as rational and manageable. The competition between these two ideas structures many of the conversations surrounding persuasion in the 20th century, a century marked by the sudden and pronounced return of the study of rhetoric and persuasion.

You are responsible for knowing the information on this page <em>before contacting me regarding policy questions</em>.</p> <h2 id=email>Email</h2> <p>I am available to answer email from 9:00am until 5:00pm Monday through Friday. Emails arriving outside of that time will be answered at my earliest convenience, but do not count on a quick answer to emails sent late at night or on the weekends.</p> <h2 id=grading>Grading</h2> <p>Per university policy, I cannot discuss grades via email. Please visit my office hours if you would like to discuss your grade on an assignment.</p> <h3 id=grade-values>Grade Values</h3> <ul> <li>A 90-100</li> <li>B 80-89</li> <li>C 70-79</li> <li>D 60-69</li> <li>F 59 or less</li> </ul> <h3 id=feedback-and-assignment-points>Feedback and Assignment Points</h3> <p>Before each assignment, I will provide you with a copy of my grading rubric for the assignment to give you a sense of what I will be targeting in each assignment. This sheet will break down each component of your grade and add up to 100 points. I will read each assignment, mark up a rubric, and provide a few paragraphs of comments on your assignment.</p> <p>These points will be weighted according to the point breakdown described on <a href="/courses/engl354fall2017/assignments.html">the Assignments page</a>, which will determine your overall final grade.</p> <h2 id=absence--tardiness>Absence / Tardiness</h2> <p>Students are expected to attend all classes. Failure to do so, as part of a larger pattern of chronic tardiness and lateness, will result in consequences for your final grade.</p> <p><strong>Tardiness</strong> is defined as an arrival after the first five minutes of class. This behavior, while sometimes unavoidable, is disruptive. If you are running late, please do your best to enter the classroom quietly and find the first and most easily accessible seat available.</p> <h3 id=excused-absences>Excused Absences</h3> <p><a href="http://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07">Student Rule 7</a> covers the cases in which absences will be excused and in which late work will be tolerated. The following conditions will be excused:</p> <ul> <li>Participation in an activity appearing on the university authorized activity list. (see List of Authorized and Sponsored Activities)</li> <li>Death or major illness in a student’s immediate family. Immediate family may include: mother, father, sister, brother, grandparents, spouse, child, spouse’s child, spouse’s parents, spouse’s grandparents, stepmother, step-father, step-sister, step-brother, step-grandparents, grandchild, step-grandchild, legal guardian, and others as deemed appropriate by faculty member or student’s academic Dean or designee.</li> <li>Illness of a dependent family member.</li> <li>Participation in legal proceedings or administrative procedures that require a student’s presence.</li> <li>Religious holy day. (See Appendix IV.)</li> <li>Injury or Illness that is too severe or contagious for the student to attend class.</li> <li>Required participation in military duties.</li> <li>Mandatory admission interviews for professional or graduate school which cannot be rescheduled.</li> <li>Mandatory participation as a student-athlete in NCAA-sanctioned competition.</li> <li>In accordance with Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, Texas A&amp;M University shall treat pregnancy (childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy and recovery therefrom) and related conditions as a justification for an excused absence for so long a period of time as is deemed medically necessary by the student’s physician. Requests for excused absence related to pregnancy should be directed to the instructor; questions about Title IX should be directed to the University Title IX Coordinator.</li> </ul> <h3 id=note-about-excused-absences>Note About Excused Absences</h3> <p>In the event of a chronic illness or other sudden condition that will result in significant time away from class, please inform me of the situation before you return to class, so that we can work out how to handle the situation before it becomes an issue.</p> <h3 id=technology>Technology</h3> <p>In the 21st century, it is unreasonable to accept “my computer died” as an excuse for late work. If you are working on assignments on a computer, please back up your work offsite. Sites such as <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a> provide space for storing copies of your work; even a USB drive can be enough. I have recently started using <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/">BackBlaze</a> and found it to be a great and inexpensive online, automated backup. Save multiple times throughout each work session to both your backup and your computer’s copy. In this class, I hold you accountable for making sure your technology is working correctly.</p> <h2 id=late-work>Late Work</h2> <p>Under Student Rule 7.4, I am under “under no obligation to provide an opportunity for the student to make up work missed because of an unexcused absence.” However, I do accept late work and will take off 5 points for every day late. These points are removed <em>after</em> the paper is graded, such that a paper that would have received an 85% that was 3 days late will receive a 70%.</p> <p>Additionally, if you are falling behind on a project and feel that you are not going to finish on time, email me 24 hours before the assignment is due to request an extension. In this email, propose how many additional days you will need to finish the assignment. Requests for extension that do not contain this information will not be honored.</p> <h2 id=academic-integrity>Academic Integrity</h2> <p><strong>Aggie Honor Code.</strong> “<em>An Aggie does not lie, cheat, or steal, or tolerate those who do.</em>” It is the student’s responsibility to know the Aggie Honor Code and to understand what constitutes scholastic dishonesty and to avoid it all costs. Anything (particularly plagiarism and cheating on quizzes or projects) that appears to be a violation of the Aggie Honor Code will be reported to the appropriate authorities. For additional information please visit: <a href="http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu/">http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu/</a>.</p> <p>Also, the following is a helpful resource for describing kinds and severity of plagiarism.

Among other things, this legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. If you believe you have a disability requiring an accommodation, please contact Disability Services, in Cain Hall, Room B118, or call 845-1637.
