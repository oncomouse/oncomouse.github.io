Specifically, we will be exploring two themes that inform the understanding of rhetoric during this period: the discovery of the unconscious and the belief that society is a system for exchanging messages. The unconscious describes a society dominated by primal impulses and subject to violent, erratic behavior. Systems thinking marks society as rational and manageable. The competition between these two ideas structures many of the conversations surrounding persuasion in the 20th century, a century marked by the sudden and pronounced return of the study of rhetoric and persuasion.</p> </div> </div> <div class=row> </div> <div class=row> <div class='col-md-8 center-block'> <h2 id=course-overview>Course Overview</h2> <p>Welcome to Modern Rhetorical Theory.</p> <p>In this class, we will be exploring the development of rhetorical thought in the twentieth century. Specifically, we will be studying the return of rhetoric as a major focus of study. For those of you who have taken 353 (the history course), you already know that with the arrival of the scientific revolution and the emergence of logic as a tool for investigating the world, rhetoric was seen as unimportant. The twentieth century, however, represents a flowering of rhetorical thought on par with (and perhaps exceeding) the birth of the discipline in Ancient Greece.</p> <p>Additionally, as a writing intensive course, we will be studying the role of the critic in this conversation and what it means to engage in a scholarly conversation.</p> <h3 id=meeting-timelocation>Meeting Time/Location</h3> <p>MWF 10:20-11:10, LAAH 301</p> <h3 id=prerequisites>Prerequisites</h3> <p>Junior or senior classification.</p> <h3 id=learning-objectives>Learning Objectives</h3> <p>In this course, students can expect to learn:</p> <ul> <li>To comprehend the development of rhetoric as an intellectual discipline in the twentieth century.</li> <li>To understand the role of new communication and transportation technologies in shaping communication.</li> <li>To engage with a scholarly tradition in their own writing.</li> <li>To participate and evaluate the writing standards of a scholarly community.</li> </ul> <h3 id=ecampus-site>eCampus Site</h3> <p>This course has an eCampus site on which you will turn in all your <a href="assignments.html">assignments</a> and find the readings not linked from the <a href="schedule.html">schedule</a></p> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class='col-md-8 center-block'> <h1 id=assignments>Assignments</h1> <h2 id=assignment-values>Assignment Values</h2> <table class="mdl-data-table mdl-js-data-table mdl-data-table--wide"> <thead> <tr> <th>Assignment</th> <th>Due Date</th> <th>Value</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Rhetorical Term Presentation</td> <td>Continuous</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Respond, Reflect Apply Papers (3)</td> <td>See <a href="schedule.html">schedule</a></td> <td>75%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Practice RRA Paper</td> <td>09/15/2017</td> <td>5%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2 id=assignment-descriptions>Assignment Descriptions</h2> <h3 id=rhetorical-term-presentation>Rhetorical Term Presentation</h3> <p>Once during the semester, you will be required to deliver a presentation on a key term in rhetorical theory. The <a href="terms.html">list of terms can be viewed here</a>. During this presentation, you will:</p> <ul> <li>Define the term</li> <li>Discuss it's history</li> <li>Provide at least two examples of its usage in: <ul> <li>Political Speech</li> <li>TV Advertising</li> <li>Popular Culture</li> <li>Nonfiction Writing</li> <li>Journalism</li> </ul> </li> <li>Discuss contemporary applications of the term</li> <li><a href="questions.html">Ask the class a question for discussion about the term</a></li> <li>Provide a list of five (5) scholarly sources that discuss the term</li> </ul> <p>I have placed <em>A Handlist of Rhetorical Terms</em> and <em>Soucebook on Rhetoric</em> on reserve at Evans Library (in the Annex, on the Fourth Floor) as starting places (they are the standard references in the field). Additionally, Wikipedia may be a useful starting point.</p> <p>We will do one presentation per class, at the beginning of class. I will circulate a sign-up sheet and you may sign up for topics on a first come, first served basis.</p> <p><strong>You must be present on the day of your presentation to get credit for this assignment</strong>.</p> <p>You will need to provide me with your list of citations and your slides at least an hour before class.</p> <p>Finally, before the class meeting following your presentation, you will need to post a blog entry to our class blog with the definition of your term and your five sources. This blog will serve as our course reference for rhetorical theory.</p> <h3 id=respond-reflect-apply-papers-3>Respond, Reflect, Apply Papers (3)</h3> <p>The primary assignment for this course is a series of relatively short papers in which you will engage closely with the texts we read. These are designed to help you better understand and to relate to the theoretical texts we will be reading in this class, while also allowing you to show your comprehension of the readings.</p> <p>You will complete 3 of these papers, each 3-5 pages in length, spaced throughout the course of the semester.</p> <p>For each of the papers, you will write three sections:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Respond</strong>: engage directly with some aspect (usually a concept defined) with at least two texts in a substantial fashion. You must demonstrate that you understand the texts and have thought about their importance.</li> <li><strong>Reflect</strong>: consider the relationship between the text and a broader understanding of the concept in question, your understanding of language, or your knowledge of culture in general.</li> <li><strong>Apply</strong>: bring in at least one example, either personal, cultural, or otherwise that helps make these theoretical concepts concrete for you.</li> </ol> <p>You must complete all three sections for full credit. Keep in mind that these papers are also intended to be short. You must be concise and particular as you engage with each of these three tasks. Additionally, these three tasks must be connected as <strong>one</strong> cohesive essay.</p> <h4 id=attendance-component>Attendance Component</h4> <p>You do not receive a separate attendance grade in this course; however, you will receive a portion of your grade on each RRA paper based on your attendance in class. If you miss more than one (1) class or are late to (2) during the unit to which your RRA responds, you will lose points for this portion of your RRA grade.</p> <h4 id=possible-topics>Possible Topics</h4> <p>Each paper asks you to think about the relationship between what we have read about language power and broader cultural contexts (include your own life). These sets of questions are intended as a starting point; feel free to digress as much as you want from them in the course of writing your paper.</p> <h5 id=unit-1-the-public>Unit 1: The Public</h5> <ol> <li><strong>Public</strong>—Who or what is the public and why is it important to studying rhetoric? How is this concept new or strange or a problem? How do you see your relationship to "the" "public"?</li> <li><strong>Propaganda</strong>—What is the basis of propaganda? What is it for, who does it serve, and who does it affect? Where and how does propaganda exist today and might it <em>also</em> be a positive concept?</li> <li><strong>Public &amp; Propaganda</strong>—What is the relationship between the public and propaganda? Does the existence of the public <em>always</em> imply its engineering? How does the changing nature of the public today also change the nature of propaganda?</li> </ol> <h5 id=unit-2-signs-of-persuasion>Unit 2: Signs of Persuasion</h5> <ol> <li><strong>Signs</strong>—What is a sign? Why would this concept be a strange or new way of approaching linguistic power? Can you think of an example of signs having particular power in your life and how that happened?</li> <li><strong>Misunderstanding</strong>—How might misunderstanding become a basis for rhetoric? How do we identify misunderstanding and how can we use it persuasively? Where do you see persuasive misunderstandings in your life?</li> <li><strong>Time &amp; Place</strong>—When are we doing rhetoric and when are we not? What are the costs and benefits of different understandings of situating rhetoric? When was a time you particularly felt rhetorical?</li> </ol> <h5 id=unit-3-rhetoric-in-the-world>Unit 3: Rhetoric in the World</h5> <ol> <li><strong>Who Persuades</strong>—Who is capable of doing rhetoric? What relationship between users of rhetoric and oppression are implied here? Have you ever particularly felt excluded from persuasion and why?</li> <li><strong>Myth</strong>—Does rhetoric manipulate myth? If rhetoric is mythic, what does that mean about are "civilized" age? Can you think of another myth you see persuasive in society today?</li> <li><strong>Circuits</strong>—What does it mean for rhetoric to move in a public? If rhetoric circulates, what is it? Where have you seen rhetoric in circulation?</li> </ol> <h3 id=practice-rra-paper>Practice RRA Paper</h3> <p>To get you started with the RRA papers, you have a practice RRA paper due in the third week of class. You will receive a completion grade for this assignment (did you turn in a complete assignment or not?); however, I will be providing <strong>detailed</strong> feedback on this first paper to get you familiar with the expectations for the RRA papers that will be graded with a rubric.</p> <p>As with the RRA, feel free to be guided by any of the sets of questions below:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Desire</strong>—What role does unconscious desire play in decisions? Does the presence of an unconscious mean we have to change how we think about persuasion? What would be an example of the unconscious governing rational decision making?</li> <li><strong>Modernity</strong>—What do our readings allows us to question about society that the authors claim we did not notice at earlier moments? What do these changes imply for how we think about rhetoric? How are changing technologies changing our understanding of civilization today?</li> </ol> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class='col-md-8 center-block'> <h1 id=course-policies>Course Policies</h1> <p>These are the policies that govern our class. You are responsible for knowing the information on this page <em>before contacting me regarding policy questions</em>.</p> <h2 id=email>Email</h2> <p>I am available to answer email from 9:00am until 5:00pm Monday through Friday. Emails arriving outside of that time will be answered at my earliest convenience, but do not count on a quick answer to emails sent late at night or on the weekends.</p> <h2 id=grading>Grading</h2> <p>Per university policy, I cannot discuss grades via email. Please visit my office hours if you would like to discuss your grade on an assignment.</p> <h3 id=grade-values>Grade Values</h3> <ul> <li>A 90-100</li> <li>B 80-89</li> <li>C 70-79</li> <li>D 60-69</li> <li>F 59 or less</li> </ul> <h3 id=feedback-and-assignment-points>Feedback and Assignment Points</h3> <p>Before each assignment, I will provide you with a copy of my grading rubric for the assignment to give you a sense of what I will be targeting in each assignment. This sheet will break down each component of your grade and add up to 100 points. I will read each assignment, mark up a rubric, and provide a few paragraphs of comments on your assignment.</p> <p>These points will be weighted according to the point breakdown described on <a href="assignments.html">the Assignments page</a>, which will determine your overall final grade.</p> <h2 id=absence--tardiness>Absence / Tardiness</h2> <p>Students are expected to attend all classes. Failure to do so, as part of a larger pattern of chronic tardiness and lateness, will result in consequences for your final grade.</p> <p><strong>Tardiness</strong> is defined as an arrival after the first five minutes of class. This behavior, while sometimes unavoidable, is disruptive. If you are running late, please do your best to enter the classroom quietly and find the first and most easily accessible seat available.</p> <h3 id=excused-absences>Excused Absences</h3> <p><a href="http://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07">Student Rule 7</a> covers the cases in which absences will be excused and in which late work will be tolerated. The following conditions will be excused:</p> <ul> <li>Participation in an activity appearing on the university authorized activity list. (see List of Authorized and Sponsored Activities)</li> <li>Death or major illness in a student’s immediate family. Immediate family may include: mother, father, sister, brother, grandparents, spouse, child, spouse’s child, spouse’s parents, spouse’s grandparents, stepmother, step-father, step-sister, step-brother, step-grandparents, grandchild, step-grandchild, legal guardian, and others as deemed appropriate by faculty member or student’s academic Dean or designee.</li> <li>Illness of a dependent family member.</li> <li>Participation in legal proceedings or administrative procedures that require a student’s presence.</li> <li>Religious holy day. (See Appendix IV.)</li> <li>Injury or Illness that is too severe or contagious for the student to attend class.</li> <li>Required participation in military duties.</li> <li>Mandatory admission interviews for professional or graduate school which cannot be rescheduled.</li> <li>Mandatory participation as a student-athlete in NCAA-sanctioned competition.</li> <li>In accordance with Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, Texas A&amp;M University shall treat pregnancy (childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy and recovery therefrom) and related conditions as a justification for an excused absence for so long a period of time as is deemed medically necessary by the student’s physician. Requests for excused absence related to pregnancy should be directed to the instructor; questions about Title IX should be directed to the University Title IX Coordinator.</li> </ul> <h3 id=note-about-excused-absences>Note About Excused Absences</h3> <p>In the event of a chronic illness or other sudden condition that will result in significant time away from class, please inform me of the situation before you return to class, so that we can work out how to handle the situation before it becomes an issue.</p> <h3 id=technology>Technology</h3> <p>In the 21st century, it is unreasonable to accept "my computer died" as an excuse for late work. If you are working on assignments on a computer, please back up your work offsite. Sites such as <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a> provide space for storing copies of your work; even a USB drive can be enough. I have recently started using <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/">BackBlaze</a> and found it to be a great and inexpensive online, automated backup. Save multiple times throughout each work session to both your backup and your computer's copy. In this class, I hold you accountable for making sure your technology is working correctly.</p> <h2 id=late-work>Late Work</h2> <p>Under Student Rule 7.4, I am under "under no obligation to provide an opportunity for the student to make up work missed because of an unexcused absence." However, I do accept late work and will take off 5 points for every day late. These points are removed <em>after</em> the paper is graded, such that a paper that would have received an 85% that was 3 days late will receive a 70%.</p> <p>Additionally, if you are falling behind on a project and feel that you are not going to finish on time, email me 24 hours before the assignment is due to request an extension. In this email, propose how many additional days you will need to finish the assignment. Requests for extension that do not contain this information will not be honored.</p> <h2 id=academic-integrity>Academic Integrity</h2> <p><strong>Aggie Honor Code.</strong> "<em>An Aggie does not lie, cheat, or steal, or tolerate those who do.</em>" It is the student's responsibility to know the Aggie Honor Code and to understand what constitutes scholastic dishonesty and to avoid it all costs. Anything (particularly plagiarism and cheating on quizzes or projects) that appears to be a violation of the Aggie Honor Code will be reported to the appropriate authorities.
